## My Responsive Portfolio

To run locally use:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Created using Typescript, Next.Js, TailwindCSS packages included are Frame Motion, React Social Icons and React Simple Typewriter. Sanity is used for the backend, with a cms used to change data on the site such as projects, social media accounts, etc.

Will be developing and expanding upon this over time as I learn more thoughout my developer journey.
